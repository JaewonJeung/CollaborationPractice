# CollaborationPractice

Notes:
1) Pull the changes and resolve conflicts before you create a branch, commit, and push.
2) Make sure you commit your changes into a feature branch before pushing the branch. Do not commit your changes to the master branch.
3) Your feature branch should follow a convention (whatever convention your organization decides). For this repo, we will go with `<firstname firstletter><lastname>/<feature branch content>`. For example, `jjeung/readme-notes`
4) Merging your feature branch into the master branch should happen only on github (by opening a Pull request), not your local machine.
